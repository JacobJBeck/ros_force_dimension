According to [Force Dimension](https://www.forcedimension.com):

> We design and manufacture high-precision force-feedback interfaces, also 
  called [haptic][haptics_wikipedia] devices, which transmit digital 
  information to the user through the sense of touch... [O]ur haptic devices 
  are capable of rendering with great accuracy the curvature, stiffness and 
  texture properties of all forms of material.

For developers designing application that use their robots, Force Dimension 
provides a C/C++ Software Development Kit ([SDK][force_dimension_sdk]).
